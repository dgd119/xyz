## I'm not a fast track student....

It's 35 years since I first encountered buddhism on a Welsh hillside. 30 years or so since I took refuge.  I was given my preliminary practice 15 years ago.  I've not completed it.

"We must be willing to be completely ordinary people" Chogyam Trungpa once said. 30 years ago these words scared me. Who wants to be ordinary? I wanted to be extraordinary. I wanted to look straight into the eyes of God. Surely that was anything but ordinary.

But now it's OK. I couldn't tell you why. Is the practice bearing fruit, or am I just getting old? It doesn't really matter. Back to the board.
