		<content type="html"> <p>I'm currently at <a href="https://business.adobe.com/summit/adobe-summit.html">Adobe Summit</a> and this morning at the keynote we announced the beta of <a href="https://firefly.adobe.com/">Adobe Firefly</a>. Firefly is a generative AI service, which by itself isn't new, but Firefly has a strong commitment to being a more <em>responsible</em> AI service. You can read more about that and Adobe Sensei <a href="https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai.html">here</a> if you would like. As an Adobe employee, I'm obviously biased, but the focus on having a responsible service that respects creators feels like a pretty important differentiator. While there are a lot of good uses for this, I decided to have some fun with it and see how well it would do something business-critical... with cats.</p><p>For my test, I looked up a list of Dungeons and Dragons classes and found this <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes">excellent list</a> here. I then went to Firefly and used prompts like so:</p><blockquote>dungeons and dragons &lt;class&gt; as a cat</blockquote><p>In general, this worked well, but sometimes I added a bit to get things a bit closer to what I had expected. The &quot;physical&quot; classes looked pretty similar and I probably could have given a bit more context to help Firefly out, but I still found the results delightful.</p><p>Here's a Fighter:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_fighter.jpg" alt="Cat fighter" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>Here's a Paladin:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_paladin.jpg" alt="Cat paladin" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>The Barbarian, which is very similar, and could have been improved if I asked for a common weapon like an axe:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_barbarian.jpg" alt="Cat barbarian" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>Now for something really fun - the Bard. The double-sided lute was crazy and I absolutely loved it:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_bard.jpg" alt="Cat bard" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>Next up is the Cleric:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_cleric.jpg" alt="Cat cleric" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>For Druid, I specifically asked to add a &quot;leafy staff&quot;, and the result wasn't what I expected, but I loved it:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_druid.jpg" alt="Cat druid" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>Here's the Ranger - I added &quot;bow and arrow&quot; and the result was much more stylish than I expected:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_ranger.jpg" alt="Cat ranger" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>Next is the Monk:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_monk.jpg" alt="Cat monk" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>The Rogue ended up being my favorite, it looks like they're carrying the severed head of someone they just assasinated:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_rogue.jpg" alt="Cat rogue" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>Finally, while there are multiple magic-using classes in D&amp;D, I went with simple and just used &quot;wizard&quot; as a prompt. The eyes on this one are crazy good:</p><p><img src="https://static.raymondcamden.com/images/2023/03/cat_wizard.jpg" alt="Cat wizard" class="lazyload imgborder imgcenter"></p><p>This was fun, and if you want to try it yourself, head over to the <a href="https://firefly.adobe.com/">site</a> and request Beta access. I'm not sure how long it will take to get in, but if you are interested, sign up as soon as possible.</p><p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@amavcinema?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Amauri Mej√≠a</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/art-samples?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p> </content>
