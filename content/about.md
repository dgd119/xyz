# About My Work

Life’s transitions, especially during illness or at the end of life, are moments that call for deep care and understanding. I offer thoughtful and compassionate companionship, providing a calm and reassuring presence during challenging times.

Drawing on years of experience in health and social care, as well as training in psychology and counselling, I approach each visit with kindness and attentiveness. Whether offering conversation, practical support, or simply quiet companionship, my work is grounded in a commitment to preserving dignity and comfort.

As a hospital and hospice chaplaincy volunteer, I understand how vital meaningful companionship is during life’s most difficult moments. My long-term Buddhist practice informs my patient, compassionate approach to care, while my background in theology provides insight into Christian traditions and sensitivities.

My academic and professional experience includes an MSc in Cognitive Science and work as an NHS Assistant Psychologist. These experiences have shaped my broader understanding of the human condition and the value of thoughtful, compassionate support.
